# Eliza chatbot in Python for Kakaotalk
ELIZA is a mock (Rogerian) psychotherapist. <br>
The original program was described by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. <br>
This implementation of Eliza in Python was made by Wade Brainerd (github.com/wadetb) in 2018. <br>
In order to Kakaotalk Plus Friend API integration, I made the input of user and output of ELIZA converted into <i>json</i> format.
